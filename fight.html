		<h2>MADARA RIVAL</h2>

		<p>The biggest rival of Madara Uchiha, Hashirama was the First Hokage of Konohagakure. Having grown up together, the two shared quite a great bond with each other, however, it worsened over time. They fought several times throughout their lifetime and Hashirama is known to have won most of them</p>


		<P>Madara's origins received a good response. Screen Rant, in their article "15 Things You Didn't Know About Madara", pointed out that the power that Madara sought eventually took over his innocence that was once a part of him. They also praised some of his good qualities including his ideas about gender, money, and power. While describing his love for his brother Izuna, they compared it with Itachi's for Sasuke. According to Screen Rant, Madara is "one of the best evil characters in the series".[43] When first seeing Madara's past, The Fandom Post enjoyed the chaos between the Uchiha and Senju clans. Despite fighting through wars, Madara still showed humanity to the point the reviewer hoped for a spin-off based on the war.[44] In its next review, The Fandom Post enjoyed how his relationship with Hashirama was handled. When Hashirama tried offering him peace it gave the series more of a back story as it focused on the characters' past and the founding of the Hidden Leaf village.[45] Another reviewer from the same site noted that these backstories also helped fans understand the chaos that occurred within the Uchiha clan, which was previously explored in the stories of Sasuke and Itachi. Sasuke needed to resolve whether or not to team up with Madara and destroy the ninja world, leading to his decision to stick with Itachi's ideals instead.</P>

		<P> Defeating his enemies, Madara goes after the Tailed beasts to revive Ten-Tails. Madara is then confronted by Might Guy, Minato Namikaze, Gaara and Rock Lee who each use all of their forces to kill him but fail. Before killing most of his enemies, Madara is confronted by the healed Naruto Uzumaki and Sasuke Uchiha who overwhelm him. Madara is forced to escape and regain Obito's Rinnegan. Upon returning to the field, Madara succeeds in casting the Infinite Tsukuyomi. The entire world becomes trapped in the dream. Sasuke manages to save Naruto, Kakashi, and Sakura from this Illusionary Technique, and Black Zetsu stabs Madara, gaining control over his body. Black Zetsu reveals that it was never Madara's will but Kaguya's[21] Madara swells in size, Kaguya taking his place. Naruto, Sasuke, Sakura and Kakashi manage to seal Kaguya, who reverts into ten tails before being sealed spitting out Madara. Eventually, Madara dies because of the toll of both the tailed beasts and Demonic Statue removed from his body.[22] In his final moments, Madara finds real peace within the dreams of Hashirama, stating that his dream for peace has died while Hashirama's dream for peace lives on and will always keep living on as it is the better of the two. Before dying, he acknowledges the friendship of Hashirama and agrees with him when he said, that they are still friends despite everything.</P>

		<p>News of Madara's death spread fast and his corpse was secretly hidden to keep anyone from finding it and profiting from it. But Madara had planned ahead: he had scheduled an Izanagi to activate sometime after his death, changing reality to bring him back to life in exchange for his right eye's vision. Having expected this, Black Zetsu located Madara's corpse and hid itself inside Madara's body, allowing it to later deceive Madara into thinking he created it. After being revived, he left a copy in place of his real body and went into hiding with a special trophy from his fight with Hashirama: a mouthful of Hashirama's flesh that he transplanted into his wounds. It was not until decades later, towards the end of Madara's natural life, that the cells had any effect, awakening the Rinnegan (in the process restoring his right eye). With the Rinnegan he was able to summon the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path, which he used to cultivate a mindless living clone of Hashirama from which he believed he had produced a White Zetsu Army</p>

		<p>During the Third Shinobi World War, Madara found a badly injured Obito. Madara used Hashirama's cells to replace Obito's damaged extremities and placed a Forbidden Individual Curse Tag in Obito's heart as a fail-safe in case Obito ever turned against him. Until then, Madara began working towards corrupting Obito. He had Kirigakure kidnap the girl Obito loved, Rin Nohara, and seal the Three-Tails into her. He then manipulated events so that Rin would die at the hand of Obito's friend, Kakashi Hatake, while Obito watched.[25] Driven to despair, Obito offered his services to Madara. Madara divulged to Obito the history of the Sage of the Six Paths and the Ten-Tails, the details of his Eye of the Moon Plan, and various techniques that Obito would need moving forward. As a final act, he left behind Black Zetsu — what he believed to be a manifestation of his will — to provide additional guidance to Obito in pursuit of this goal. With that, Madara disconnected from the Demonic Statue and, with his dying breath, entrusted Obito with his name: Madara Uchiha.[</p>
